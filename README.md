## Usage

```
$ touch <fileâ€¦>
```

If the file specified in the argument does not exist, it will be created.
If the file already exists, its timestamp will be updated.

You can also list multiple files in the argument.

### -c

If you specify the option `c`, the file will not be created if it does noe exist.
If it already exists, the timestamp will be updated as usual.

### -d <%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S>

Specifies the timestamp.

### -r \<file\>

Set the timestamp to the same time as another file.

> [!TIP]
> The d and r options cannot be specified at the same time.
